Challenge 3 for bootcamp.
The task was to modify a Employee payroll tracker.

I had problems with creating the array of employees. I couldn't figure out how to
use the employeeArray outside of the first function.

I think i converted to salary to a number using NaN.

I also tried putting in the random employee function which didn't work. i believe because of the
employeeArray.
